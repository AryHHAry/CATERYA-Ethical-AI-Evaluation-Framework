## Vision for Collaboration

CATERYA is designed as a **collaborative ecosystem**, not a solo endeavor. We believe the most robust ethical AI frameworks emerge from diverse perspectives—physicists and philosophers, engineers and ethicists, regulators and researchers.

This document outlines how individuals, organizations, and institutions can contribute to and benefit from CATERYA.

### Premium Services (Future Revenue)

**Ethical Audit Platform** (SaaS):
- Managed cloud infrastructure
- Automated report generation
- Multi-team collaboration features
- Historical tracking and trend analysis
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Compliance Suite**:

### Revenue Allocation

- 50%+ to core development (improve open-source)
- 20-30% to community growth (events, grants, scholarships)
- 10-20% to research (datasets, academic collaborations)
- <10% to operations (legal, accounting, infrastructure)

### Principles

1. **No Feature Lockout**: Premium services are conveniences, not capabilities. Everything premium does can be done (with more effort) in open-source.
2. **Time-Limited Exclusivity**: Premium features released as open-source after 1-2 years.
3. **Community Input**: Major commercial decisions discussed publicly.
4. **Sustainability, Not Extraction**: Revenue supports mission, doesn't prioritize VC returns.
